I'm currently a third year PhD student working under professor [Natalia Ivanova](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ivanova1/) at the University of Alberta. My current research focuses on testing a more generalized and improved magnetic braking prescription described in [Van & Ivanova 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191105790V/abstract). Using [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) and the resources provided by [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/), I simulate a grid of initial binaries and compare the results to observed systems.
