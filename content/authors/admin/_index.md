Hi I'm Kenny and I have a passion for analytics and machine learning. I recently graduated with a Ph.D from the University of Alberta under the supervision of professor [Natalia Ivanova](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ivanova1/). My research involved using a numerical simulations, statistical analysis and data visualization to model stellar systems resulting in numerous [scientific publications](#featured). Throughout my graduate research I gained experience in machine learning, data analysis, and high performance computing. I am currently looking to start a career in data analytics or machine learning.
