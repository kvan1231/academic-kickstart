I'm Currently a third year PhD student working under professor <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ivanova1/", target="_blank">Natalia Ivanova</a> at the University of Alberta. My Current research focuses on testing a more generalized and improved magnetic braking prescription described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456..263P", target="_blank"> Pavlovskii et al. 2015</a>. Using <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net/", target="_blank"> MESA </a> and the resources provided by <a href="https://www.computecanada.ca/", target="_blank"> Compute Canada </a>, I simulate a grid of initial binaries and compare the results to observed systems.
