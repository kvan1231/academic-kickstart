summary: "A poster summarizing the effectiveness of different magnetic braking prescriptions in reproducing observed LMXBs"
abstract: "We present a new method for constraining the mass transfer evolution of low and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries â€“ a reverse population synthesis technique. This is done using the detailed 1D stellar evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) and evolving a range of binary systems with different magnetic braking prescriptions. These simulated systems are then compared to the observed properties seen in persistent low mass X-ray binaries and allowing us to determine possible progenitors to these binaries. In addition to constraining progenitor systems of observed systems, this study also allows us to further constrain magnetic braking recipes. For this, we compare the populations formed with different magnetic braking laws and the observed populations, using Bayesian statistics. While an absolute probability of producing an observed system cannot be found, comparisons between prescriptions is possible giving and indication where different magnetic braking schemes encounter problems."
