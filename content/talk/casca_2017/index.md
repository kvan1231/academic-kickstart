summary: "A poster presenting preliminary work of a statistical study of different magnetic braking prescriptions"
abstract: "We present an alternative method in constraining the mass transfer evolution of low and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries by using a reverse population synthesis technique. We constrain the possible results obtained by population synthesis using the detailed 1D stellar evolution code MESA. This is done by using the properties observed in persistent binaries to constrain possible population of binaries at the onset of Roche lobe overflow and mass transfer. In addition to constraining progenitor systems of observed systems, this study also allows us to further constrain magnetic braking prescriptions."
